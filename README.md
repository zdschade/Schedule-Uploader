# Schedule-Uploader
Uses OCR to read an image of a paper schedule and automatically make Google Calendar events for your shifts

Done as a graduation requirement at Harrisburg University of Science and Technology (Project 2)
Mostly proof-of-concept just to make sure it was reasonable to read pictures of paper schedules and to test out the Google Calendar library.



## Technologies

Python
  - PyTesseract (OCR Library)
  - Flask
  - Google Calendar Library

Web
  - HTML/CSS
  - Javascript
  - Get/Fetch Requests

## Other notes

The project is ugly as-is. It was meant as a proof-of-concept to be developed on a more appropriate platform later, like Android. I will update this project with a link to the new version when I start it.

Languages lean heavily on JS becuase I had to download two of the modules I used. See the "Static" folder.

You need to have tesseract installed to use this locally, so it will likely not work out of the box if you download this. Feel free to do so and try to get it to run though :)
